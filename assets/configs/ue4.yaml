        vr.PixelDensity:
          hint: |-
            Pixel density sets the VR render target texture size as a factor of recommended texture size.
            The recommended texture size is the size that will result in no under sampling in most distorted area of the view when computing the final image to be displayed on the device by the runtime compositor.
            Note that the recommended texture size will likely be larger than the display panel resolution of the device as the texture is used as input data for the final composition/lens distortion pass provided by the device's runtime.
            A pixel density of 1.0 (default) will use the device's recommended texture size.

        vr.StereoLayers.bMixLayerPriorities:

        r.CompileShadersForDevelopment:
          hint: |-
            Setting this to 0 allows to ship a game with more optimized shaders as some
            editor and development features are not longer compiled into the shaders.
             Note: This should be done when shipping but it's not done automatically yet (feature need to mature
                   and shaders will compile slower as shader caching from development isn't shared).
            Cannot be changed at runtime - can be put into BaseEngine.ini

             0: tree order starting with the root, first all inputs then dependencies (classic UE4, unconnected nodes are not getting executed)
             1: RegisterPass() call order, unless the dependencies (input and additional) require a different order (might become new default as it provides more control, executes all registered nodes)

        r.DelaySceneRenderCompletion:
          hint: |-

            Actual math: float Factor = max(ViewWidth / 1920 - 1, 0); DepthBlurRadius *= 1 + Factor * (CVar - 1)
             1: No adjustments (default)

            If on, the current frame will be forced to finish and render to the screen instead of being buffered.  This will improve latency, but slow down overall performance.
        r.FlushRHIThreadOnSTreamingTextureLocks:

        r.ForceStripAdjacencyDataDuringCooking:
          hint: |-
            If set, adjacency data will be stripped for all static and skeletal meshes during cooking (acting like the target platform did not support tessellation).

        r.Forward.MaxCulledLightsPerCell:
          hint: |-
            Controls how much memory is allocated for each cell for light culling.  When r.Forward.LightLinkedListCulling is enabled, this is used to compute a global max instead of a per-cell limit on culled lights.

          hint: |-
            Whether to use forward shading on desktop platforms - requires Shader Model 5 hardware.
            Forward shading has lower constant cost, but fewer features supported. 0:off, 1:on
            This rendering path is a work in progress with many unimplemented features, notably only a single reflection capture is applied per object and no translucency dynamic shadow receiving.

             1: windowed full screen (quick switch between applications and window mode, slight performance loss)
             any other number behaves like 0
