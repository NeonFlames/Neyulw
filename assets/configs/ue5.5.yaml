             1: on - showing light count onto the depth buffer
             2: on - showing max light count per tile accoung for each slice but the last one (culling there is too conservative)
             3: on - showing max light count per tile accoung for each slice and the last one 
            
        r.Forward.LightGridDebug.MaxThreshold:

          hint: |-
            Determines the ray hit lighting mode:
            0 - Use Lumen Surface Cache for ray hit lighting. This method gives the best GI and reflection performance, but quality will be limited by how well surface cache represents given scene.
            1 - Calculate lighting at a ray hit point for GI and reflections. This will improve both GI and reflection quality, but greatly increases GPU cost, as full material and lighting will be evaluated at every hit point. Lumen Surface Cache will still be used for secondary bounces.
            2 - Calculate lighting at a ray hit point for reflections. This will improve reflection quality, but increases GPU cost, as full material needs to be evaluated and shadow rays traced. Lumen Surface Cache will still be used for GI and secondary bounces, including GI seen in reflections.
        r.Lumen.HardwareRayTracing.MaxIterations:
          hint: |-
            Limit number of ray tracing traversal iterations on supported platfoms.

            Orthographic near planes can be behind the camera position, which causes some issues with Unreal resolving lighting behind the camera position This CVar enables the Orthographic cameras globally to automatically update the camera location to match the NearPlane location, and force the pseudo camera position to be the replaced near plane location for the projection matrix calculation. This means Unreal can resolve lighting behind the camera correctly.

          hint: |-
            When auto evaluating clip planes, determines whether 16bit depth scaling should be used.16bit scaling is advantageous for any depth downscaling that occurs (e.g. HZB downscaling uses 16 bit textures instead of 32).This feature will calculate the maximum depth scale needed based on the Unreal Unit (cm by default) to Pixel ratio.It assumes that we don't need 32bit depth range for smaller scenes, because most actors will be within a reasonable visible frustumHowever it does still scale up to a maximum of UE_OLD_WORLD_MAX which is the typical full range of the depth buffer, so larger scenes still work too.
        r.Ortho.AutoPlanes.DepthScale:
          hint: |-
            Allows the 16 bit depth scaling to be adjusted from the  default +FP16 Max (66504.0f)This is useful if the far plane doesn't need to be as far away, so it will improve depth deltas

            If enabled, the PSO precaching system will not precache PSOs that the D3D12 graphics driver considers similar for caching, i.e. it will not precache PSOs that while technically different will still result in a driver cache hit.
            This is not implemented for all GPU vendors and can result in performance issues or cache misses if the heuristics the engine uses does not match the graphics driver's behavior that decides whether a PSO is in the cache or not.

            This can speed up the re-creation of precached PSOs for NVIDIA drivers and avoid small hitches, at the cost of memory.
            It's recommended to set r.PSOPrecache.KeepInMemoryGraphicsMaxNum and r.PSOPrecache.KeepInMemoryComputeMaxNum to a non-zero value to ensure the number of in-memory PSOs is bounded.
        r.PSOPrecache.LightMapPolicyMode:

             1: PF_A2B10G10R10 32Bit
             2: PF_FloatR11G11B10 32Bit
             3: PF_FloatRGB 32Bit
             4: PF_FloatRGBA 64Bit (default, might be overkill, especially if translucency is mostly using SeparateTranslucency)

        r.SceneCulling:
          hint: |-
            Enable/Disable scene culling.
              While enabled, it will only build the instance hierarchy if used by any system - currently that corresponds to Nanite being enabled.

            Set the minimum cell size & level in the hierarchy, rounded to nearest POT. Clamps the level for object footprints.
              This trades culling effectiveness for construction cost and memory use.
              The minimum cell size is (will be) used for precomputing the key for static ISMs.

          hint: |-
            Controls the absolute maximum number of rendered pixel before any upscaling such that doesn't go higher than the specified 16:9 resolution of this variable. For instance set this value to 1440 so that you are not rendering more than 2560x1440 = 3.6M pixels. This is useful to set this on PC in your project's DefaultEditor.ini so you are not rendering more pixel on PC in PIE that you would in average on console with your project specific dynamic resolution settings.
        r.ScreenPercentage.MinResolution:
          hint: |-
            Controls the absolute minimum number of rendered pixel.
        r.ScreenshotDelegate:
          hint: |-

            Allows to disable the separate translucency feature (all translucency is rendered in separate RT and composited
            after DOF, if not specified otherwise in the material).
             0: off (translucency is affected by depth of field)

            Max (uncompressed) size of a group of shaders to be compressed/decompressed together.If a group exceeds it, it will be evenly split into subgroups which strive to not exceed it. However, if a shader group is down to one shader and still exceeds the limit, the limit will be ignored.
        r.ShaderCodeLibrary.MaxShaderPreloadWaitTime:
          hint: |-
            If we wait on shader preloads longer than this amount of seconds, we will log it as a warning.

        r.ShaderCodeLibrary.VisualizeShaderUsage:
          hint: |-
            If 1, a bitmap with the used shaders (for each shader library chunk) will be saved at the exit. Works in standalone games only.
        r.ShaderCompiler.AllowDistributedCompilation:
          hint: |-

            if != 0, cache outputs are discarded (not added to the output map) for debugging purposes.
            Eliminates usefulness of the cache, but allows repeated triggering of the same jobs for stress testing (for example, rapid undo/redo in the Material editor).
        r.ShaderCompiler.DebugDumpDetailedShaderSource:
          hint: |-
            If true, and if the preprocessed job cache is enabled, this will dump multiple copies of the shader source for any job which has debug output enabled:
            	1. The unmodified output of the preprocessing step as constructed by the PreprocessShader implementation of the IShaderFormat (Preprocessed_<shader>.usf
            	2. The stripped version of the above (with comments, line directives, and whitespace-only lines removed), which is the version hashed for inclusion in the job input hash when the preprocessed job cache is enabled (Stripped_<shader>.usf)	3. The final source as passed to the platform compiler (this will differ if the IShaderFormat compile function applies further modifications to the source after preprocessing; otherwise this will be the same as 2 above (<shader>.usf)
            If false, or the preprocessed job cache is disabled, this will simply dump whatever source is passed to the compiler (equivalent to either 1 or 3 depending on if the IShaderFormat implementation modifies the source in the compile step.

        r.ShaderCompiler.DebugDumpShaderCodePlatformHashes:
          hint: |-
            If true, each shader job will dump a PlatformHash.txt file containing the shader code hash as reported by the platform compiler (if the associated shader format registers this hash with the shader stats).
            Note the distinction between this and OutputHash.txt - these files can be used to find shaders which have identical code and only result in different output hashes due to diffs in other metadata.
        r.ShaderCompiler.DebugDumpWorkerCrashLog:

        r.ShaderCompiler.DumpDebugInfoForCacheHits:
          hint: |-
            If true, debug info (via IShaderFormat::OutputDebugData) will be output for all jobs including duplicates and cache/DDC hits. If false, only jobs that actually executed compilation will dump debug info.

        r.ShaderCompiler.MemoryLimit:
          hint: |-
            Specifies a memory limit (in MiB) for all ShaderCompileWorker (SCW) processes.If the total memory consumption of all SCW processes exceeds this limit, the editor will start to suspend workers and reschedule compile jobs.By default 0, effectively disabling the limitation. If this is non-zero, it must be greater than or equal to 1024 since shader compilation must be granted at least 1024 MiB of memory in total.
        r.ShaderCompiler.ParallelInProcess:
          hint: |-
            EXPERIMENTAL- If true, shader compilation will be executed in-process in parallel. Note that this will serialize if the legacy preprocessor is enabled.

          hint: |-
            The target time (in ms) to spend precompiling each frame when cpre-optimizing or 0.0 to disable. When precompiling is faster the batch size will grow and when slower will shrink to attempt to occupy the full amount. Defaults to 10.0 (off).
        r.ShaderPipelineCache.PreCompileMask:
          hint: |-
            Mask used to precompile the cache. Defaults to all PSOs (-1)
        r.ShaderPipelineCache.PreOptimizeEnabled:
          hint: |-

        r.ShaderPipelineCache.SaveAfterPSOsLogged:
          hint: |-
            Set the number of PipelineStateObjects to log before automatically saving. 0 will disable automatic saving (which is the default now, as automatic saving is found to be broken).
        r.ShaderPipelineCache.SaveBoundPSOLog:
          hint: |-
            If > 0 then a log of all bound PSOs for this run of the program will be saved to a writable user cache file. Defaults to 0 but is forced on with -logpso.
        r.ShaderPipelineCache.SaveUserCache:
          hint: |-
            If > 0 then any missed PSOs will be saved to a writable user cache file for subsequent runs to load and avoid in-game hitches. Enabled by default on macOS only.
        r.ShaderPipelineCache.StartupMode:
          hint: |-
            Sets the startup mode for the PSO cache, determining what the cache does after initialisation:

        r.ShaderPipelineCacheTools.IgnoreObsoleteStableCacheFiles:
          hint: |-
            When set to the default value of 0, building the cache (and usually the whole cook) will fail if any .spc file can't be loaded, to prevent further testing.
            By setting to 1, a project may choose to ignore this instead (warning will still be issued).
        r.ShaderPipelineCacheTools.IncludeComputePSODuringCook:
          hint: |-
            0 disables cook-time addition, 1 enables cook-time addition, 2 adds only Niagara PSOs.

        r.Shadow.OcclusionCullCascadedShadowMaps:
          hint: |-
            Whether to use occlusion culling on cascaded shadow maps.  Disabled by default because rapid view changes reveal new regions too quickly for latent occlusion queries to work with.

          hint: |-
            Number of frames before a light that has been moving (updated or transform changed) goes to inactive state.
              This determines the number of frames that the MobilityFactor goes to zero over, and thus a higher number spreads invalidations out over a longer time.
        r.shadow.ShadowMapsRenderEarly:
          hint: |-
            If enabled, shadows will render earlier in the frame. This can help async compute scheduling on some platforms

        r.Shadow.ShadowMaxSlopeScaleDepthBias:
          hint: |-
            Max Slope depth bias used for shadows for all lights
            Higher values give better self-shadowing, but increase self-shadowing artifacts
        r.Shadow.ShouldBeginDeferredCullingAfterShadowRendering:
          hint: |-
            Temporary: If turned on, a new deferred scope of instance culling will be started directly after shadow depth rendering (iff instance occlusion culling is enabled) to work around a bug.
        r.Shadow.SkipCullingNaniteMeshes:
          hint: |-
            When enabled, CPU culling will ignore nanite meshes.

        r.Shadow.TransitionScale:
          hint: |-
            This controls the 'fade in' region between a caster and where its shadow shows up.  Larger values make a smaller region which will have more self shadowing artifacts
        r.Shadow.TranslucentPerObject.ProjectEnabled:
          hint: |-
            Enable/Disable translucency shadows on a per-project basis. Turning off can significantly reduce the number of permutations if your project has many translucent materials.

            DynamicShadowCascades to use when using CSM to preview unbuilt lighting from a directional light
        r.Shadow.UnbuiltPreviewInGame:
          hint: |-
            Whether to render unbuilt preview shadows in game.  When enabled and lighting is not built, expensive preview shadows will be rendered in game.  When disabled, lighting in game and editor won't match which can appear to be a bug.
        r.Shadow.UnbuiltWholeSceneDynamicShadowRadius:
          hint: |-
            WholeSceneDynamicShadowRadius to use when using CSM to preview unbuilt lighting from a directional light
        r.Shadow.UseOctreeForCulling:
          hint: |-
            Whether to use the primitive octree for shadow subject culling.  The octree culls large groups of primitives at a time, but introduces cache misses walking the data structure.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.AccumulateStats:
          hint: |-
            When nonzero, VSM stats will be collected over multiple frames and written to a CSV file output to the Saved/Profiling directory.
              If set to a number N > 0 it will auto disable and write the result after N frames, if < 0 it must be manually turned off by setting back to 0.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.AllocatePagePoolAsReservedResource:
          hint: |-
            Allocate VSM page pool as a reserved/virtual texture, backed by N small physical memory allocations to reduce fragmentation.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache:
          hint: |-
            Turn on to enable caching
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.AllocateViaLRU:
          hint: |-
            Prioritizes keeping more recently requested cached physical pages when allocating for new requests.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.ClipmapPanning:
          hint: |-
            Enable support for panning cached clipmap pages for directional lights, allowing re-use of cached data when the camera moves. Keep this enabled outside of debugging.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.CPUCullInvalidationsOutsideLightRadius:
          hint: |-
            CPU culls invalidations that are outside a local light's radius.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.DebugSkipDynamicPageInvalidation:
          hint: |-
            Skip invalidation of cached pages when geometry moves for debugging purposes. This will create obvious visual artifacts when disabled.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.DebugSkipRevealedPrimitivesInvalidation:
          hint: |-
            Debug skip invalidation of revealed Non-Nanite primitives, i.e. they go from being culled on the CPU to unculled.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.DeformableMeshesInvalidate:
          hint: |-
            If enabled, Primitive Proxies that are marked as having deformable meshes (HasDeformableMesh() == true) cause invalidations regardless of whether their transforms are updated.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.DrawInvalidatingBounds:
          hint: |-
            Turn on debug render cache invalidating instance bounds, heat mapped by number of pages invalidated.
               1  = Draw all bounds.
               2  = Draw those invalidating static cached pages only
               3  = Draw those invalidating dynamic cached pages only
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.ForceInvalidateDirectional:
          hint: |-
            Forces the clipmap to always invalidate, useful to emulate a moving sun to avoid misrepresenting cache performance.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.InvalidateUseHZB:
          hint: |-
             When enabled, instances invalidations are tested against the HZB. Instances that are fully occluded will not cause page invalidations.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.MaxLightAgeSinceLastRequest:
          hint: |-
            The maximum number of frames to allow lights (and their associated pages) that aren't present in the current frame to live in the cache.
            Larger values can allow pages from offscreen local lights to live longer, but can also increase various page table management overheads.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.MaxPageAgeSinceLastRequest:
          hint: |-
            The maximum number of frames to allow cached pages that aren't requested in the current frame to live. 0=disabled.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.StaticSeparate:
          hint: |-
            When enabled, caches static objects in separate pages from dynamic objects.
            This can improve performance in largely static scenes, but doubles the memory cost of the physical page pool.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.StaticSeparate.FramesStaticThreshold:
          hint: |-
            Number of frames without an invalidation before an object will transition to static caching.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.FirstCoarseLevel:
          hint: |-
            First level of the clipmap to mark coarse pages for. Lower values allow higher resolution coarse pages near the camera but increase total page counts.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.FirstLevel:
          hint: |-
            First level of the virtual clipmap. Lower values allow higher resolution shadows closer to the camera, but may increase page count.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.GreedyLevelSelection:
          hint: |-
            When enabled, allows greedily sampling more detailed clipmap levels if they happen to be mapped.
            This can increase shadow quality from certain viewing angles, but makes the clipmap boundry less stable which can exacerbate visual artifacts at low shadow resolutions.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.LastCoarseLevel:
          hint: |-
            Last level of the clipmap to mark coarse pages for. Higher values provide dense clipmap data for a longer radius but increase total page counts.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.LastLevel:
          hint: |-
            Last level of the virtual clipmap. Indirectly determines radius the clipmap can cover. Each extra level doubles the maximum range, but may increase page count.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.MinCameraViewportWidth:
          hint: |-
            If greater than zero, clamps the camera viewport dimensions used to adjust the clipmap resolution.
            This can be useful to avoid dynamic resolution indirectly dropping the shadow resolution far too low.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.UseConservativeCulling:
          hint: |-
            Conservative culling removes the frustum-clipped culling volume for the non-nanite geometry for VSM rendering. This means a lot more geometry is submitted, and also marked as rendered.
            Useful to diagnose if there are culling artifacts in virtual shadow map clip maps due to errors in the tracking code.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.WPODisableDistance:
          hint: |-
            When enabled, disables WPO animation in clipmap levels based on a primitive's WPO disable distance and r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.WPODisableDistance.LodBias setting.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.WPODisableDistance.LodBias:
          hint: |-
            The number of clipmap levels further than the distance that an instance would be animated to allow shadow animation.
            Typically 2-4 works well but may need to be adjusted for very low light angles with significant WPO movement.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.ZRangeScale:
          hint: |-
            Scale of the clipmap level depth range relative to the radius. Affects z-near/z-far of the shadow map. Should generally be at least 10 or it will result in excessive cache invalidations. Values that are too large cause depth imprecisions and shadow flickering.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.CoarsePagePixelThresholdDynamic:
          hint: |-
            If a dynamic (non-nanite) instance has a smaller estimated pixel footprint than this value, it should not be drawn into a coarse page. Higher values cull away more instances.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.CoarsePagePixelThresholdDynamicNanite:
          hint: |-
            If a dynamic Nanite instance has a smaller estimated pixel footprint than this value, it should not be drawn into a coarse page. Higher values cull away more instances.
            This value is typically lower than the non-Nanite one because Nanite has lower overhead for drawing small objects.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.CoarsePagePixelThresholdStatic:
          hint: |-
            If a static (non-nanite) instance has a smaller estimated pixel footprint than this value, it should not be drawn into a coarse page. Higher values cull away more instances.
            This value is typically lower than the non-static one because the static pages have better caching.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.CullBackfacingPixels:
          hint: |-
            When enabled does not generate shadow data for pixels that are backfacing to the light.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.DebugDrawFroxelRange:
          hint: |-
            Range in froxel tiles from the mouse cursor which to draw debug froxels in.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.DebugDrawFroxels:
          hint: |-
            Render the froxels using shaderprint (which needs to be enabled) r.ShaderPrint.MaxLine also needs to be set to a high value as this produces many lines.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.DebugSkipMergePhysical:
          hint: |-
            Skip the merging of the static VSM cache into the dynamic one. This will create obvious visual artifacts when disabled.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.DistantLightForceCacheFootprintFraction:
          hint: |-
            Fraction of footprint size below which start force-caching lights that are invalidated (i.e., are moving or re-added)
              Larger values may improve performance but may also produce more visible artifacts
              The base footprint is based on the page size.
              0.0 == Never force-cache (default), 1.0 == Always force-cache.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.DistantLightMode:
          hint: |-
            Control whether distant light mode is enabled for local lights.
            0 == Off, 
            1 == On (default), 
            2 == Force All.
            When on, lights with a pixel footprint below the threshold are marked as distant. Updates to distant lights are throttled (force-cached), they use simpler page-table logic and the memory cost is lower.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.DynamicHZB:
          hint: |-
            When enabled, a separate HZB is built for dynamic cached pages.
            This can improve performance in cached scenes with a lot of dynamic overdraw, e.g. a forest with a static sun light.
            Constructing separate HZB doubles the memory cost of the HZB (1/4 of the page pool) and incurs some cost for building the second HZB.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.DynamicRes.MaxPagePoolLoadFactor:
          hint: |-
            If allocation exceeds this factor of total page pool capacity, shadow resolution will be biased downwards. 0 = disabled
        r.Shadow.Virtual.DynamicRes.MaxResolutionLodBias:
          hint: |-
            As page allocation approaches the pool capacity, VSM resolution ramps down by biasing the LOD up, similar to 'ResolutionLodBiasDirectional'.
            This is the maximum LOD bias to clamp to for global dynamic shadow resolution reduction. 0 = disabled
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Enable:
          hint: |-
            Enable Virtual Shadow Maps. Renders geometry into virtualized shadow depth maps for shadowing.
            Provides high - quality shadows for next - gen projects with simplified setup.High efficiency culling when used with Nanite.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.ForceFullHZBUpdate:
          hint: |-
            Forces full HZB update every frame rather than just dirty pages.
            
        r.Shadow.Virtual.ForceOnlyVirtualShadowMaps:
          hint: |-
            If enabled, disallow creation of conventional non-virtual shadow maps for any lights that get a virtual shadow map.
            This can improve performance and save memory, but any geometric primitives that cannot be rendered into the virtual shadow map will not cast shadows.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.ForcePerLightShadowMaskClear:
          hint: |-
            For debugging purposes. When enabled, the shadow mask texture is cleared before the projection pass writes to it. Projection pass writes all relevant pixels, so clearing should be unnecessary.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.MarkCoarsePagesDirectional:
          hint: |-
            Marks coarse pages in directional light virtual shadow maps so that low resolution data is available everywhere.Ability to disable is primarily for profiling and debugging.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.MarkCoarsePagesLocal:
          hint: |-
            Marks coarse pages in local light virtual shadow maps so that low resolution data is available everywhere.Ability to disable is primarily for profiling and debugging.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.MarkPagesUsingFroxels:
          hint: |-
            Experimental: If enabled the virtual shadow map pages are marked using froxels that are generated during HZB build.
              Higher throughput as it is not bandwidth limited. Is approximate as it only marks the center of each froxel representing 8x8 pixels.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.MarkPixelPages:
          hint: |-
            Marks pages in virtual shadow maps based on depth buffer pixels. Ability to disable is primarily for profiling and debugging.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.MarkPixelPagesMipModeLocal:
          hint: |-
            When enabled, this uses a subset of mips to reduce instance duplication in VSMs. Will result in better performance but a harsher falloff on mip transitions.
             0 - Disabled: Use all 8 mips
             1 - Quality Mode: Use 4 higher res mips (16k, 4k, 1k, 256)
             2 - Performance Mode: Use 4 lower res mips (8k, 2k, 512, 128)
            
        r.Shadow.Virtual.MaxDistantUpdatePerFrame:
          hint: |-
            Maximum number of distant lights to update each frame. Invalidated lights that were missed may be updated in a later frame (round-robin).
        r.Shadow.Virtual.MaxPhysicalPages:
          hint: |-
            Maximum number of physical pages in the pool.
            More space for pages means more memory usage, but allows for higher resolution shadows.
            Ideally this value is large enough to fit enough pages for all the lights in the scene, but not too large to waste memory.
            Enable 'ShowStats' to see how many pages are allocated in the pool right now.
            For more page pool control, see the 'ResolutionLodBias*', 'DynamicRes.*' and 'Cache.StaticSeparate' cvars.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.Nanite.MaterialVisibility:
          hint: |-
            Enable Nanite CPU-side visibility filtering of draw commands, depends on r.Nanite.MaterialVisibility being enabled.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.Batch:
          hint: |-
            .
        r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.CulledInstanceAllocationFactor:
          hint: |-
            Allocation size scale factor for the buffer used to store instances after culling.
            The total size accounts for the worst-case scenario in which all instances are emitted into every clip or mip level.
            This is far more than we'd expect in reasonable circumstances, so this scale factor is used to reduce memory pressure.
            The actual number cannot be known on the CPU as the culling emits an instance for each clip/mip level that is overlapped.
            Setting to 1.0 is fully conservative. Lowering this is likely to produce artifacts unless you're certain the buffer won't overflow.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.IncludeInCoarsePages:
          hint: |-
            Include non-Nanite geometry in coarse pages.Rendering non-Nanite geometry into large coarse pages can be expensive; disabling this can be a significant performance win.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.LargeInstancePageAreaThreshold:
          hint: |-
            How large area is considered a 'large' footprint, summed over all overlapped levels, if set to -1 uses the physical page pool size / 8.
            Used as a threshold when storing page area coverage stats for diagnostics.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.MaxCulledInstanceAllocationSize:
          hint: |-
            Maximum number of instances that may be output from the culling pass into all VSM mip/clip levels. At 12 byte per instance reference this represents a 1.5GB clamp.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.NumPageAreaDiagSlots:
          hint: |-
            Number of slots in diagnostics to report non-nanite instances with the largest page area coverage, < 0 uses the max number allowed, 0 disables.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.SinglePassBatched:
          hint: |-
            .
        r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.UseHZB:
          hint: |-
            Cull Non-Nanite instances using HZB.
              Set to 0 to disable.
              Set to 1 to use HZB from previous frame. Can incorrectly cull in some cases due to outdated data.
              Set to 2 to use two-pass Nanite culling with HZB from the current frame.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.UseRadiusThreshold:
          hint: |-
            If enabled (default) the r.Shadow.RadiusThreshold cvar is also used for uncached virtual shadow maps to cull small non-nanite instances.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNaniteVSM:
          hint: |-
            Enable support for non-nanite Virtual Shadow Maps.Read-only and to be set in a config file (requires restart).
        r.Shadow.Virtual.NormalBias:
          hint: |-
            Receiver offset along surface normal for shadow lookup. Scaled by distance to camera.Higher values avoid artifacts on surfaces nearly parallel to the light, but also visibility offset shadows and increase the chance of hitting unmapped pages.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.OnePassProjection:
          hint: |-
            Projects all local light virtual shadow maps in a single pass for better performance.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.OnePassProjection.MaxLightsPerPixel:
          hint: |-
            Maximum lights per pixel that get full filtering when using one pass projection and clustered shading.Generally set to 8 (32bpp), 16 (64bpp) or 32 (128bpp). Lower values require less transient VRAM during the lighting pass.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.OnePassProjection.SkipScreenShadowMask:
          hint: |-
            Allows skipping the screen space shadow mask entirely when only a virtual shadow map would write into it.
            Should generally be left enabled outside of debugging.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.PageDilationBorderSizeDirectional:
          hint: |-
            If a screen pixel falls within this fraction of a page border for directional lights, the adacent page will also be mapped.Higher values can reduce page misses at screen edges or disocclusions, but increase total page counts.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.PageDilationBorderSizeLocal:
          hint: |-
            If a screen pixel falls within this fraction of a page border for local lights, the adacent page will also be mapped.Higher values can reduce page misses at screen edges or disocclusions, but increase total page counts.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.PageMarkingPixelStrideX:
          hint: |-
            During page marking, instead of testing every screen pixel, test every Nth pixel.
            Page marking from screen pixels is used to determine which VSM pages are seen from the camera and need to be rendered.
            Increasing this value reduces page-marking costs, but could introduce artifacts due to missing pages.
            With sufficiently low values, it is likely a neighbouring pixel will mark the required page anyway.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.PageMarkingPixelStrideY:
          hint: |-
            Same as PageMarkingPixelStrideX, but on the vertical axis of the screen.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.ResolutionLodBiasDirectional:
          hint: |-
            Bias applied to LOD calculations for directional lights. -1.0 doubles resolution, 1.0 halves it and so on.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.ResolutionLodBiasDirectionalMoving:
          hint: |-
            Bias applied to LOD calculations for directional lights that are moving. -1.0 doubles resolution, 1.0 halves it and so on.
            The bias transitions smoothly back to ResolutionLodBiasDirectional as the light transitions to non-moving, see 'r.Shadow.Scene.LightActiveFrameCount'.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.ResolutionLodBiasLocal:
          hint: |-
            Bias applied to LOD calculations for local lights. -1.0 doubles resolution, 1.0 halves it and so on.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.ResolutionLodBiasLocalMoving:
          hint: |-
            Bias applied to LOD calculations for local lights that are moving. -1.0 doubles resolution, 1.0 halves it and so on.
            The bias transitions smoothly back to ResolutionLodBiasLocal as the light transitions to non-moving, see 'r.Shadow.Scene.LightActiveFrameCount'.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.ScreenRayLength:
          hint: |-
            Length of the screen space shadow trace away from receiver surface (smart shadow bias) before the VSM / SMRT lookup.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.ShowClipmapStats:
          hint: |-
            Set to the number of clipmap you want to show stats for (-1 == off)
        r.Shadow.Virtual.ShowLightDrawEvents:
          hint: |-
            Enable Virtual Shadow Maps per-light draw events - may affect performance especially when there are many small lights in the scene.

            Shoot fewer rays in fully shadowed and unshadowed regions. Currently only supported with OnePassProjection. 
        r.Shadow.Virtual.SMRT.ExtrapolateMaxSlopeDirectional:
          hint: |-
            Maximum depth slope when extrapolating behind occluders for directional lights.
            Higher values allow softer penumbra edges but can introduce light leaks behind second occluders.
            Setting to 0 will disable slope extrapolation slightly improving projection performance, at the cost of reduced penumbra quality.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.SMRT.ExtrapolateMaxSlopeLocal:
          hint: |-
            Maximum depth slope when extrapolating behind occluders for local lights.
            Higher values allow softer penumbra edges but can introduce light leaks behind second occluders.
            Setting to 0 will disable slope extrapolation slightly improving projection performance, at the cost of reduced penumbra quality.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.SMRT.MaxRayAngleFromLight:
          hint: |-
            Max angle (in radians) a ray is allowed to span from the light's perspective for local lights.Smaller angles limit the screen space size of shadow penumbra. Larger angles lead to more noise. 
        r.Shadow.Virtual.SMRT.MaxSlopeBiasLocal:
          hint: |-
            Maximum depth slope. Low values produce artifacts if shadow resolution is insufficient. High values can worsen light leaks near occluders and sparkly pixels in shadowed areas.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.SMRT.RayCountDirectional:
          hint: |-
            Ray count for shadow map tracing of directional lights. 0 = disabled.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.SMRT.RayCountLocal:
          hint: |-
            Ray count for shadow map tracing of local lights. 0 = disabled.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.SMRT.RayLengthScaleDirectional:
          hint: |-
            Length of ray to shoot for directional lights, scaled by distance to camera.Shorter rays limit the screen space size of shadow penumbra. Longer rays require more samples to avoid shadows disconnecting from contact points. 
        r.Shadow.Virtual.SMRT.SamplesPerRayDirectional:
          hint: |-
            Shadow map samples per ray for directional lights

          hint: |-
            Applies a dither to the shadow map ray casts for directional lights to help hide aliasing due to insufficient shadow resolution.
            Setting this too high can cause shadows light leaks near occluders.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.SMRT.TexelDitherScaleLocal:
          hint: |-
            Applies a dither to the shadow map ray casts for local lights to help hide aliasing due to insufficient shadow resolution.
            Setting this too high can cause shadows light leaks near occluders.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.SubsurfaceShadowMinSourceAngle:
          hint: |-
            Minimum source angle (in degrees) used for shadow & transmittance of sub-surface materials with directional lights.
            To emulate light diffusion with sub-surface materials, VSM can increase the light source radius depending on the material opacity.
            The higher this value, the more diffuse the shadowing with these materials will appear.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.TranslucentQuality:
          hint: |-
            Quality of shadow for lit translucent surfaces. This will be applied on all translucent surfaces, and has high-performance impact.
            Set to 1 to enable the high-quality mode.
        r.Shadow.Virtual.UseConservativeDistantLightThreshold:
          hint: |-
            Base the distant light cutoff on the minimum mip level instead of the shadow resolution calculated through the old path.
              This fixes problems around the use of an inscribed sphere.

              0: disabled;
              1: enabled.
            
        r.TSR.AsyncCompute:
          hint: |-
            Controls how TSR run on async compute. Some TSR passes can overlap with previous passes.
             0: Disabled;
             1: Run on async compute only passes that are completly independent from any intermediary resource of this frame, namely ClearPrevTextures and ForwardScatterDepth passes;
             2: Run on async compute only passes that are completly independent or only dependent on the depth and velocity buffer which can overlap for instance with translucency or DOF. Any passes on critical path remains on the graphics queue (default);
             3: Run all passes on async compute;
        r.TSR.Debug.ArraySize:
          hint: |-
            Size of array for the TSR.Debug.* RDG textures
        r.TSR.ForceSeparateTranslucency:
          hint: |-
            Overrides r.SeparateTranslucency whenever TSR is enabled (enabled by default).
            
        r.TSR.History.R11G11B10:
          hint: |-
            Select the bitdepth of the history. r.TSR.History.R11G11B10=1 Saves memory bandwidth that is of particular interest of the TSR's UpdateHistory's runtime performance by saving memory both at previous frame's history reprojection and write out of the output and new history.
            This optimisation is unsupported with r.PostProcessing.PropagateAlpha=True.
            
            Please also not that increasing r.TSR.History.ScreenPercentage=200 adds 2 additional implicit encoding bits in the history compared to the TSR.Output's bitdepth thanks to the downscaling pass from TSR history resolution to TSR output resolution.
        r.TSR.History.SampleCount:
          hint: |-
            Maximum number sample for each output pixel in the history. Higher values means more stability on highlights on static images, but may introduce additional ghosting on firefliers style of VFX. Minimum value supported is 8.0 as TSR was in 5.0 and 5.1. Maximum value possible due to the encoding of the TSR.History.Metadata is 32.0. Defaults to 16.0.
            
            Use "r.TSR.Visualize 0" command to see how many samples where accumulated in TSR history on areas of the screen.
        r.TSR.History.ScreenPercentage:
          hint: |-
            Resolution multiplier of the history of TSR based of output resolution. While increasing the resolution adds runtime cost to TSR, it allows to maintain a better sharpness and stability of the details stored in history through out the reprojection.
            
            Setting to 200 brings on a very particular property relying on NyQuist-Shannon sampling theorem that establishes a sufficient condition for the sample rate of the accumulated details in the history. As a result only values between 100 and 200 are supported.
            It is controlled by default in the anti-aliasing scalability group set to 200 on Epic and Cinematic, 100 otherwise.
        r.TSR.History.UpdateQuality:
          hint: |-
            Selects shader permutation of the quality of the update of the history in the TSR HistoryUpdate pass currently driven by the sg.AntiAliasingQuality scalability group. For further details about what each offers, you are invited to look at DIM_UPDATE_QUALITY in TSRUpdateHistory.usf and customise to your need.
        r.TSR.LensDistortion:
          hint: |-
            Whether to apply lens distortion in TSR at runtime (enabled by default, requires r.TSR.Support.LensDistortion enabled at cook time).
        r.TSR.RejectionAntiAliasingQuality:
          hint: |-
            Controls the quality of TSR's built-in spatial anti-aliasing technology when the history needs to be rejected. While this may not be critical when the rendering resolution is not much lowered than display resolution, this technic however becomes essential to hide lower rendering resolution rendering because of two reasons:
             - the screen space size of aliasing is inverse proportional to rendering resolution;
             - rendering at lower resolution means need more frame to reach at least 1 rendered pixel per display pixel.
            
            Use "r.TSR.Visualize 6" command to see on screen where the spatial anti-aliaser quicks in green.
            
            By default, it is only disabled by default in the low anti-aliasing scalability group.
        r.TSR.ReprojectionField:
          hint: |-
            Enables TSR's reprojection field for higher reprojection vector upscale and dilate quality (Enabled by default on high, epic and cinematic anti-aliasing quality).
            
            When the reprojection fields is enabled, it dilates the reprojection vector by half spatially anti-aliased rendering pixel from the depth buffer, instead by a full rendering pixel in dilate velocity pass. This allows hide the rendering resolution due whenever velocity buffer ends up extruding some object to edges, for instance when rotating. This come at the cost of spatial anti-aliasing in the DilateVelocity pass as well as an extra dependent texture fetches right at the begining of the HistoryUpdate pass.
            
            The reprojection field also embeds a jacobian 2x2 matrix for each pixel to have more precise reprojection of the historyfor the display pixels in the rendering pixels. This for instance allows to maintains sharp geometric edges on movements.
        r.TSR.ReprojectionField.AntiAliasPixelSpeed:
          hint: |-
            Defines the output pixel velocity at which point the dilation should be spatial anti-aliased based of the depth buffer to avoid reprojection aliasing by extrusion on fast geometric edges (Default to 0.125, best tuned with r.TSR.Visualize=11).
        r.TSR.Resurrection:
          hint: |-
            Allows TSR to resurrect previously discarded details from many frames ago.
            
            When enabled, the entire frames of the TSR are stored in a same unique Texture2DArray including a configurable number of persistent frame (defined by r.TSR.Resurrection.PersistentFrameCount) that are occasionally recorded (defined by r.TSR.Resurrection.PersistentFrameInterval).
            Then every frame, TSR will attempt to reproject either previous frame, or the oldest persistent frame available based which matches best the current frames. The later option will happen when something previously seen by TSR shows up again (no matter through parallax disocclusion, shading changes, translucent VFX moving) which will have the advantage bypass the need to newly accumulate a second time by simply resurrected the previously accumulated details.
            
            Command "r.TSR.Visualize 4" too see parts of the screen is being resurrected by TSR in green.
            Command "r.TSR.Visualize 5" too see the oldest frame being possibly resurrected.
            
            Currently experimental and disabled by default.
        r.TSR.Resurrection.PersistentFrameCount:
          hint: |-
            Configures the number of persistent frame to record in history for futur history resurrection. This will increase the memory footprint of the entire TSR history. Must be an even number greater or equal to 2. (default=2)
        r.TSR.Resurrection.PersistentFrameInterval:
          hint: |-
            Configures in number of frames how often persistent frame should be recorded in history for futur history resurrection. This has no implication on memory footprint of the TSR history. Must be an odd number greater or equal to 1. Uses the VisualizeTSR show flag and r.TSR.Visualize=5 to tune this parameter to your content. (default=31)
        r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering:
          hint: |-
            Instability in TSR output 99% of the time coming from instability of the shading rejection, for different reasons:
             - One first source of instability is most famously moire pattern between structured geometry and the rendering pixel grid changing every frame due to the offset of the jittering pixel grid offset;
             - Another source of instability can happen on extrem geometric complexity due to temporal history's chicken-and-egg problem that can not be overcome by other mechanisms in place in TSR's RejectHistory pass: how can the history be identical to rendered frame if the amount of details you have in the rendered frame is not in history? how can the history accumulate details if the history is too different from the rendered frame?
            
            When enabled, this flickering temporal analysis monitor how the luminance of the scene right before any translucency drawing stored in the TSR.Flickering.Luminance resource how it involves over successive frames. And if it is detected to constantly flicker regularily above a certain threshold defined with this r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.* cvars, the heuristic attempts to stabilize the image by letting ghost within luminance boundary tied to the amplititude of flickering.
            
            Use "r.TSR.Visualize 7" command to see on screen where this heuristic quicks in orange and red. Pink is where it is disabled.
            
            One particular caveat of this heuristic is that any opaque geometry with incorrect motion vector can make a pixel look identically flickery quicking this heuristic in and leaving undesired ghosting effects on the said geometry. When that happens, it is highly encourage to verify the motion vector through the VisualizeMotionBlur show flag and how these motion vectors are able to reproject previous frame with the VisualizeReprojection show flag.
            
            The variable to countrol the frame frequency at which a pixel is considered flickery and needs to be stabilized with this heuristic is defined with the r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period in frames. For instance, a value r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period=3, it means any pixel that have its luminance changing of variation every more often than every frames is considered flickering.
            
            However another caveats on this boundary between flickering pixel versus animated pixel is that: flickering happens regardless of frame rate, whereas a visual effects that are/should be based on time and are therefore independent of the frame rate. This mean that a visual effect that looks smooth at 60hz might appear to 'flicker' at lower frame rates, like 24hz for instance.
            To make sure a visual effect authored by an artists doesn't start to ghost of frame rate, r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.AdjustToFrameRate is enabled by default such that this frame frequency boundary is automatically when the frame rate drops below a refresh rate below r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.FrameRateCap.
            
            While r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering is controled based of scalability settings turn on/off this heuristic on lower/high-end GPU the other r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.* can be set orthogonally in the Project's DefaultEngine.ini for a consistent behavior across all platforms.
            
            It is enabled by default in the anti-aliasing scalability group High, Epic and Cinematic.
        r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.AdjustToFrameRate:
          hint: |-
            Whether r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period settings should adjust to frame rate when below r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.FrameRateCap. Please read r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering's help for further details. (Enabled by default).
        r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.FrameRateCap:
          hint: |-
            Framerate cap in hertz at which point there is automatic adjustment of r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period when the rendering frame rate is lower. Please read r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering's help for further details. (Default to 60hz)
        r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.MaxParallaxVelocity:
          hint: |-
            Some material might for instance might do something like parallax occlusion mapping such as CitySample's buildings' window's interiors. This often can not render accurately a motion vector of this fake interior geometry and therefore make the heuristic believe it is in fact flickering.
            
            This variable define the parallax velocity in 1080p pixel at frame rate defined by r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.FrameRateCap at which point the heuristic should be disabled to not ghost. 
            (Default to 10 pixels 1080p).
            
        r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period:
          hint: |-
            Periode in frames in which luma oscilations at equal or greater frequency is considered flickering and should ghost to stabilize the image Please read r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering's help for further details. (Default to 3 frames).
        r.TSR.ShadingRejection.SampleCount:
          hint: |-
            Maximum number of sample in each output pixel of the history after total shading rejection.
            
            Lower values means higher clarity of the image after shading rejection of the history, but at the trade of higher instability of the pixel on following frames accumulating new details which can be distracting to the human eye (Defaults to 2.0).
        r.TSR.ShadingRejection.TileOverscan:
          hint: |-
            The shading rejection run a network of convolutions on the GPU all in single 32x32 without roundtrip to main video memory. However chaining many convlutions in this tiles means that some convolutions on the edge arround are becoming corrupted and therefor need to overlap the tile by couple of padding to hide it. Higher means less prones to tiling artifacts, but performance loss.
        r.TSR.Support.LensDistortion:
          hint: |-
            Whether to compile lens distortion support in TSR's shaders (adds the lens distortion LUT in the HistoryUpdate pass in branches that even disabled can add a bit of VALU cost when no lens distortion is used).
             0: unsupported;
             1: supported only on desktop (default);
             2: supported everywhere;
            
        r.TSR.Velocity.WeightClampingPixelSpeed:
          hint: |-
            Defines the output pixel velocity at which the the high frequencies of the history get's their contributing weight clamped. It's basically to lerp the effect of r.TSR.Velocity.WeightClampingSampleCount when the pixel velocity get smaller than r.TSR.Velocity.WeightClampingPixelSpeed. (Default = 1.0f).
        r.TSR.Velocity.WeightClampingSampleCount:
          hint: |-
            Number of sample to count to in history pixel to clamp history to when output pixel velocity reach r.TSR.Velocity.WeightClampingPixelSpeed. Higher value means higher stability on movement, but at the expense of additional blur due to successive convolution of each history reprojection.
            
            Use "r.TSR.Visualize 0" command to see how many samples where accumulated in TSR history on areas of the screen.
            
            Please note this clamp the sample count in history pixel, not output pixel, and therefore lower values are by designed less noticeable with higher r.TSR.History.ScreenPercentage. This is done so such that increasing r.TSR.History.ScreenPercentage uniterally & automatically give more temporal stability and maintaining sharpness of the details reprojection at the expense of that extra runtime cost regardless of this setting.
            
            A story telling game might preferer to keep this 4.0 for a 'cinematic look' whereas a competitive game like Fortnite would preferer to lower that to 2.0. (Default = 4.0f).
        r.TSR.Visualize:
          hint: |-
            Selects the TSR internal visualization mode.

             -1: Display an grid based overview on the VisualizeTSR show flag (default, opened with the `show VisualizeTSR` command at runtime or Show > Visualize > TSR in editor viewports);
              0: Number of accumulated samples in the history, particularily interesting to tune r.TSR.ShadingRejection.SampleCount and r.TSR.Velocity.WeightClampingSampleCount;
              1: Parallax disocclusion based of depth and velocity buffers;
              2: Mask where the history is rejected;

              9: Reprojection field's dilating offset to apply in the HistoryUpdate;
             10: Coverage of the dilating offset to apply in the HistoryUpdate (red the coverage is close to 0, green is close to 1, blue has been fully dilated to 1 without computing any spatial anti-aliasing from the depth buffer);
             11: Mask where the reprojection field is anti-aliased from the depth buffer in green (handy to tune r.TSR.ReprojectionField.AntiAliasPixelSpeed);
             12: Mask where the pixel's jacobian is null in the reprojection field in orange;
             13: Mask where the pixel's jacobian has reached its encoding limit in the reprojection field in red;
             14: Mask where the reprojected history is upscaled (in red) or downscaled (in green) by the reprojection field's jacobian (for instance due to getting closer or further away from camera respectively, or an object is getting scaled dynamicaly);
            
        r.TSR.WaveOps:
          hint: |-
            Whether to use wave ops in the shading rejection heuristics to speeds up convolutions.
            
            The shading rejection heuristic optimisation can be particularily hard for shader compiler and hit bug in them causing corruption/quality loss.
            
            Note this optimisation is currently disabled on SPIRV platforms (mainly Vulkan and Metal) due to 5min+ compilation times in SPIRV backend of DXC which is not great for editor startup.
